# cs50-final-project
This is my final project for cs50 course offered on edx by Harvard. It is a web application where students can calculate their cgpa/gpa.\
I used several technologies while preparing this project which are:\
    1. Python and Flask\
    2. HTML and CSS\
    3. Javascript\
    4. Jinja\
    5. Bootstrap\
\
Here you can find an explanatory video of the project.
