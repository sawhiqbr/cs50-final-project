# cs50-final-project
This is my final project for cs50 course offered on edx by Harvard. It is a web application where students can calculate their cgpa/gpa.
I used several technologies while preparing this project which are:\n
    1. Python and Flask\n
    2. HTML and CSS\n
    3. Javascript\n
    4. Jinja\n
    5. Bootstrap\n

Here you can find an explanatory video of the project.
